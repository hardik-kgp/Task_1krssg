This is a lift operating system whuch uses the basic model of FSM(finite state machine) using states UP DOWN AND HALT to
traverse from one floor to another floor by switching from one floor to another floor.Everytime at a particular floor it
checks whether there is a halt at the floor or not.If it is it prints the floor.

Then it recursively changes it floor untill it reaches the first or last floor where it changes it state.
